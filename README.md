# Pill-Pal
A pal to help elderly people keep track of their pills
## Inspiration
Many of us know the feeling of having to remind our older loved ones to take their medication. We made this in hopes of easing the stress of reminding.

## What it does
This program allows the user to add pills to their schedule, the amounts they need to take, what days they need to take them, and what times during the day. The user can indicate which pills they have taken, and the program will remind them to contact their provider when their supply is getting low. They are able to look at their schedule of pills and the amounts of pills at any time.

## How we built it
We used replit and coded in python.

## Challenges we ran into
We had trouble trying to integrate a UI which gave us complications with our code. We ended up deciding to make it a console program instead. We also wanted to implement a notification system to the desktop, but we couldn't figure out how to implement it without errors in replit.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud that we were able to keep our code structured and concise with so many features. We also made it look nice without using a GUI. 

## What we learned
We learned that we were able to effectively use our different experience levels in python and implement the features that we wanted.

## What's next for Pill Pal
We would really love to add a GUI and the ability to contact their pharmacy automatically if their pills are getting low. We would also like to add the ability to make an account to save your previous data and add contacts of close family members so that they can be notified.
